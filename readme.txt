Admin page debugger tool

== Description ==

Toggles human and machine language (aka ID-s) on admin pages.

= Only for development! =

This plugin shows you the ID-s of almost all form fields including selects,
checkboxes and radio buttons like in `wp-admin/options.php`.

It works only on WordPress Settings API-like formatted &mdash; not necessarily API generated &mdash; admin pages.
E.g. `<input>` elements cannot be wrapped in `<span>`.

= Activation =

You can find the plugin's checkbox in standard Screen Options (upper right corner).
This checkbox could be overwritten &mdash; thus hidden &mdash; by poorly written plugins.
To restrict Machine Language to a certain admin page, copy this to your `wp-config.php`:

`
define( 'MACHINE_LANGUAGE_HOOK', 'load-options-reading.php' );
`

For example this line causes to run only on Settings / Reading.

= Features =

* Basically all input ID-s are displayed in place of labels, actually `for` attributes of labels
* `select`-s get a title showing all option values comma separated (hover over `select`-s with your mouse)
* `option`-s get values appended in the form of "original option text|value"
* Radio button and checkbox labels will show: "name|value"
* Descriptions (`p`-s and `span`-s with "description" class) will be hidden,
this way Machine Language will clean up all admin pages,
descriptions are hidden by CSS, so there's no [FOUC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_of_unstyled_content)

= Other notes =

* Radio buttons or checkboxes with empty value are displayed with the "Empty Set"
Unicode character: "âˆ…" (U+2205) ( e.g. Settings / Permalinks / Default )
* `select`-s with empty values are not
* The plugin's checkbox in Screen Options is effective immediately
* The code is designed as a must use plugin, so there is no separated Javascript or CSS file
* State of Machine Language is saved as a user option so it is a per user setting

= Links =

Development goes on on [GitHub](https://github.com/szepeviktor/machine-language).

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload `machine-language.php` to the `wp-content/mu-plugins/` or `wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress (if you've chosen the `plugins` dir)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I inspect form fields not altered? =

Even if your admin page is not generated by the [Setting API](https://github.com/voceconnect/voce-settings-api)
you should output HTML like in WordPress Settings pages.

= Should I use Machine Language in production? =

No, you shouldn't.
